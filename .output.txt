{"id":3918216928,"number":18,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"Resolve address from pointer before every read operation","body":"As an AntFTP user\nI want to resolve the pointer name to an address for each read operation\nSo that if the pointer address is changed by a prior write by any user, the latest archive address will be resolved \n\nGiven any changes to an archive require the pointer content to be updated to the new public archive address\nWhen a read operation occurs (get, list)\nThen the pointer client should resolve the latest address for the connection\nAnd libunftp::Server::with_anttp_pointer is provided a PointerServiceClient instead of the resolved address\nAnd resolve_pointer function is moved from main.rs to lib.rs within the unftp-sbe-anttp crate\n\nGiven testing would improve quality\nWhen adding pointer support\nThen update the unit tests and integration tests to reflect the ability to pass in and update a pointer\n\nImplementation Notes\n\n- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code\n- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml\n- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)\n- Implement basic unit

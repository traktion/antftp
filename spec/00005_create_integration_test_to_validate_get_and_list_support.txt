As a software engineer
I want validate that I can list and get files using AntFTP
So that I can connect a simple FTP client in read only mode and download files

Given the skeleton code for GET and LIST already exist
When confirming that GET and LIST are supported
Then create a simple integration test to connect to the running AntFTP instance, LIST files, then GET a file
And use the archive at 'cec7a9eb2c644b9a5de58bbcdf2e893db9f0b2acd7fc563fc849e19d1f6bd872', which should be passed in via a command line option
And clap should be installed to support the setting of the archive to pass into 'libunftp::Server::with_anttp'
And use suppaftp (or better) as the FTP client library

Given the are likely integration test failures
When errors occur
Thne debug them and update unftp-sbe-anttp/src/lib.rs with any corrections needed to allow the tests to pass

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)

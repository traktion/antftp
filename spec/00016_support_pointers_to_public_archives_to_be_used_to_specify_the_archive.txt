As an AntFTP user
I want to provide a pointer to a public archive
So that I when I update an archive, the pointer is updated to point its new address

Given there is a pointer.proto which provides GetPointer gRPC call
When a pointer name is provided as a CLI argument (with -p)
Then when creating a new Anttp server instance, retrieve the public archive address from the pointer
By calling GetPointer with address set to the pointer name provided in the CLI argument
And use the Pointer content returned as the public archive address

Given there is a pointer.proto which provides UpdatePointer gRPC call
When a pointer name is provided as a CLI argument (with -p)
Then when a public archive is updated, then the pointer is also updated with the archive's new address
And use store-type = 'disk' to stage the changes in AntTP

Given PUT, DEL, MKD FTP commands all update the public archive
When one of these commands is used
Then update the pointer content to the new public archive when these commands are executed 

Given pointer name and content must be provided to update a pointer
When updating a pointer
Then create call UpdatePointer with a pointer with the name passed in as a CLI argument and the address returned from the updated public archive

Given the clap library is used to add command line arguments
When adding the new pointer name argument
Then update main.rs args with pointer_name, which can be set with a long (pointer-name) or short parameter (-p)
And when both an archive and a pointer are specified, used the pointer (and ignore the archive)
And use archive (address) returned from GetPointer (pointer.content) instead

Given testing would improve quality
When adding pointer support
Then update the unit tests and integration tests to reflect the ability to pass in and update a pointer

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00016_issue_title.txt)
- Implement basic unit tests

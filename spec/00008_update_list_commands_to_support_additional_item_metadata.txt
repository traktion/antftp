As a software engineer
I want to see additional item metadata when I retrieve a public archive
So that I can show file paths, names, sizes, modification dates and whether they are directories

Given /proto/public_archive.proto has been updated to include more data for items
When when executing a GET command
Then download the proto from https://github.com/traktion/AntTP/blob/master/proto/public_archive.proto and store it in /proto/public_archive.proto (overwrite existing)
And extract the data from the proto and populate the Fileinfo structs with the additional data retrieved

Given testing would improve quality
When adding the PUT command
Then update the unit tests and integration tests to reflect the new DEL command

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of antftp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Implement basic unit tests

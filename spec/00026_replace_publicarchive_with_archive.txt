As an AntFTP user
I want to be able to interact with both public archives and tarchives by using the standard archive protobuf
So that I don't need to implement specific tarchive support or require users to choose one source or another

Given archive.proto has been added to AntTP, which can interact with both public archives and tarchives
When adding tarchive support
Then refactor lib.rs to use archive.proto by downloading it from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traktion/AntTP/refs/heads/master/proto/archive.proto and adding to /proto and /crates/unftp-sbe-anttp/proto
And update GetPublicArchiveRequest, UpdatePublicArchiveRequest, TruncatePublicArchiveRequest to use GetArchiveRequest, UpdateArchiveRequest, TruncateArchiveRequest
And replace PublicArchiveServiceClient with ArchiveServiceClient
And update build.rs to correctly create archive.proto structs

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)

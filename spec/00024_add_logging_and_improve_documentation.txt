As an AntFTP user
I want to see logs for each command that is executed and each time the data is synced to the Autonomi network
So that it is easy to observe application behaviour

Given logging is needed to explain what the application is doing
When adding logging
Then add 'log' dependency
And add log output for each FTP command and for each time the archive/pointer is synced to the Autonomi network

Given there are additional command line options
When making these changes
Then improve README.md to include the sync timer details
And an explanation of what the sync timer does

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)

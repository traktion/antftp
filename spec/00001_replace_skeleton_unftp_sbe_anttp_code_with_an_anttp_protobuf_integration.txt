Issue #1: Replace skeleton unftp-sbe-anttp code with an AntTP protobuf integration

Implementation Notes:
- connect to anttp at localhost:18887
- directory listing is done via the `items` field in GetPublicArchive
- file retrieval is done via the `content` field in GetPublicArchive
- other storage backend methods are stubbed

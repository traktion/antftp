Update tarchive and public archive protos and impacted code

As a software engineer
I want update the proto files for public_archive.proto and tarchive.proto to the latest version
So that I can take advantage of their latest features

Given there are new protobufs for archives
When upgrading protos
Then download https://github.com/traktion/AntTP/blob/master/proto/public_archive.proto for public archives
And download https://github.com/traktion/AntTP/blob/master/proto/tarchive.proto for tarchives
And update dependencies to reflect the changes

Given path handling is different in the new protos
When updating protos
Then update PUT and MKD FTP commands in lib.rs to correctly set the path for all files

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00012_update_tarchive_and_public_archive_protos_and_impacted_code.txt)
- Implement basic unit tests

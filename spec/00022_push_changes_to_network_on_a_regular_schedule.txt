Issue #22: Push changes to network on a regular schedule

As an AntFTP user
I want to push changes staged in the AntTP cache to Autonomi network
So that they can be downloaded from the network by other users/devices 

Given changes should be uploaded to the network periodically
When new changes have been staged in the AntTP cache (store-type = disk)
Then every X minutes, both the pointer and the archive should be pushed to the network
And X should be set as a clap argument called network-sync-timer, with a short name of -n, with a default of 10
And the pointer should be persisted to the network by calling update_pointer with store-type = network
And the archive should be persisted to the network by calling PushPublicArchive with store-type = network
And the existing functions should be refactored to accept store-type as an argument for both use cases

Given public_archive.proto has been updated
When starting to implement this feature
Then download the latest /proto/public_archive.proto from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/traktion/AntTP/refs/heads/master/proto/public_archive.proto

Given AntTP can manage the state of pointers and public archives
When the application needs to push changes to the network
Then the network sync code can execute from a different thread to make the code cleaner
And the last address of the pointer should be stored after sync, so that the routine can test whether the address has changed before attempting sync the following time
And async-job crate should be used to define the sync job in a similar way to AntTP CachingClient job here: https://github.com/traktion/AntTP/blob/master/src/client/caching_client.rs#L58

Given testing would improve quality
When adding pointer support
Then update the unit tests and integration tests to reflect the ability to pass in and update a pointer

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Implement basic unit tests
